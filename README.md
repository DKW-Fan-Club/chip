## Install Steps

You should install the following items:

1. Rust (install using `rustup` please. If `rustup` asks you to remove the operating system version of Rust, *make sure to do that*. On Ubuntu or WSL, that's done by `sudo apt-get purge rust`.)
2. Verilator (`sudo apt-get install verilator` on Ubuntu or WSL)
3. GTKWave (`sudo apt-get install gtkwave` on Ubuntu or WSL)
4. GCC C++ compiler (`sudo apt-get install g++` on Ubuntu or WSL)

Make sure that the following commands succeed: `which cargo`, `which verilator`, `which gtkwave`, `which g++`. If on Windows, please use WSL.

Next, install `buck2` following the [official guide](https://buck2.build/docs/about/getting_started/).

Clone this repository and then run:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Using Buck

### Simple Tutorial

Let's walk through a simple workflow: we wish to debug our `adder`.

1. Run `buck2 test //hardware/adder:all_tests`. You can observe that everything before the `:` is a path to a folder (containing our adder), and after the `:` is the name of a function inside the `BUCK` file at that folder.
2. We'll see that an assertion failed. Uh oh! `buck2` tells us this is from the test suite called `tb_basic_functionality`.
3. Run `buck2 run //hardware/adder:tb_basic_functionality_visualize`. This will open GTKWave, where you can explore the waveform and debug the issue.
4. Find the issue, and fix the testbench. Re-run the tests, and they should pass!

### Creating a new module

Run `buck2 run //utils:create_module name_of_module` to create a new module. This will:

-   set up the Buck build for your module
-   create `hardware/name_of_module/name_of_module.sv` for your module's code
-   create `hardware/name_of_module/tb_basic_functionality.sv` for a basic testbench

By default, your module will have a dependency on the shared `types` package. If you wish to add additional dependencies, follow the format of how dependencies are declared for the `cgra` module in the DKW fan club repo.

If other modules will depend on your module, you must edit is visibility list to include those modules. You can find an example visibility list on the `functional_unit` module in the DKW fan club repo.

Once you have written your module, you can test it like we did in the basic tutorial.

### Adding more tests to your module

Logically separate tests should be placed in separate testbenches. This makes debugging easier. To add a new testbench, create a new `.sv` file for it, and add the following to your `BUCK` file:

```
sv_module(
    name = "tb_name_of_test",
    srcs = ["tb_name_of_test.sv"],
    top = "tb",
    deps = [":your_module"]
)
sv_module_test(
    name = "tb_name_of_test",
    module = ":tb_name_of_test"
)
```

Then, add `":tb_name_of_test"` to the array of tests for the `all_tests` group. For clarity, it is recommended to always have the `tb_` prefix, although it's not required.

Unless you provide `generate_waveforms = False` to `sv_module_test`, for any test, you can run `buck2 run //hardware/module:name_of_test_visualize` to see the waveforms after running the test. Note that tests may run faster if you don't generate waveforms.

### Running only a specific test
If you want to run only one test, instead of using `buck2 test //hardware/your_module:all_tests`, you can run `buck2 test //hardware/your_module:tb_name_of_test`.

### Creating additional test groups
As you saw previously, the `all_tests` suite contains every test. You can copy the `test_suite` block with a different name to create a separate group of tests. For example:
```
test_suite(
    name = "name_of_group",
    tests = [":tb_some_test", ":tb_other_test"]
)
```
You can run all of these tests with `buck2 test //hardware/your_module:name_of_group`.
